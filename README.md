# <Challenge-1-horizon>

## Description

-As a new developer, My main motivation for this project was to learn and begin to comprehend refactoring the challenge code to make it more accesible.

-I built this project with the intention of making the site more user friendly. Thus making the website more optimized for search engine optimization bringing in more users.

-The problem with this website is that it was not accessible for a more wide range of users (i.e) visually impaired users and older users. By adding alt atributes to the img elements screen readers are now able to be used on this site.

-I learned how to avoid div soup by changing all div elements to a semantic style of code that makes more sense. I also learned how to fix breaking css code to match the index.html so the site doesn't change the layout of the site.
